Analysis of sex crimes on US university campuses

regressionplot_11-Dec-2014.pdf - The x axis is university enrollment (logged) and the y axis is sex crimes/assault reported by the university. There maybe huge reporting bias though. Even though there is a statistically significant relationship (run test_correlation.m, r^2 = 0.1823, ordinary least squares slope = 9.5576, p value = 2.6740e-49), it may be explained more by distinct clusters of universities. 

cluster_plot_07-Dec-2014.pdf - There are though two distinct clusters, schools with low sex crimes regardless of enrollment and those with high
enrollment and high sex crimes (apparent on crime vs log10 enrollment
plot). Run kmeans_clustering.m
