Open source code and data for open source data science.

* List of projects

1) university_sexcrimes
Analysis of data on sex crimes in US university campuses.

2) heart_disease_risk_prediction
Predicting heart disease risk from open data.

3) cancer_mortality_prediction
Predicting cancer survival using logistic regression from open data.

4) predicting_news_popularity
Predicting popularity of news articles from open data.

5) opensource_mapping_project
Open source mapping project. 

6) astroinformatics
Analysis of astronomy data using machine learning techniques.

7) scientific_collaboration
Project to analyze planetary scale scientific collaboration data.

8) accident_prediction
Road accident forecasting and data exploration project.

9) patterns_in_crime
Predicting patterns of crime using data science. Larger cities have disproportionately more crime per capita compared to smaller cities (super-linear scaling of crime). We used techniques from dynamical systems and complex systems to explain the super-linear scaling of crime in cities and other socio-technological systems

10) spam_classification
Building an SVM based spam classifier trained on data from the UCI repository
 
11) breast_cancer_prediction
Download data from the UCI machine learning repository to make predictions
for breast cancer. A few features turn out to be really important for prediction like epithelial cell size. This uses a random forest.
